# WFD - What's For Dinner?

Skip the paywalls and life stories and get to the recipes.

A simple recipe parser and UI for parsing recipes into an easy to read and follow format.

This project takes advantage of the [Recipe Schema](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe) that recipes use for SEO. This data is tucked away in a <head> tag and will allow for getting around paywalls.
